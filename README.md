### Additional Tools

#### Investor for Uniswap

Edit the configuration file **src/config.ts** with your tokens and weights
Select "true" or "false" if you want to sell all the tokens balance before reinvestment.

```

npx ts-node  src/investor.ts true
```

#### Rebalancer for Uniswap

#### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

The DCA module allows the user to periodically invest a fixed amount in tokens over time, reducing the impact of volatility. It is set up with a configuration that includes the investment amount, tokens, and intervals.

To use the DCA module, edit the investment configuration in src/config.ts with your desired tokens, investment amounts, and intervals. Execute the script via:

```shell
npx ts-node src/dca.ts 
```

#### Market Prediction (DCA)

This module uses historical price data to predict future price movements of tokens, employing techniques like linear regression. It aims to inform trading decisions by anticipating market trends.

Ensure the prediction settings are correctly configured in src/config.ts. To run the prediction module, use the following command:

```shell
npx ts-node src/predict.ts bitcoin
```

#### Pump-and-dump tool for Uniswap

This tool buys or sells the entire balance of a specified token in the pair

```shell
npx ts-node src/pumpOrDump.ts <token1> token2> <action>
```

Command line arguments:

token1: Reserve token name if configured (eg. WBNB) or token contract address <br />
token2: Shit token's name if configured (eg. DARK) or token contract address <br />
action: 'pump' | 'dump' <br />

- Pump sells all of token1 for token2
- Dump reverses the pump selling all of token2 for token1
